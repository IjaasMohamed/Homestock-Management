# Homestock Management System

## Overview
The Homestock Management System is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application designed to streamline inventory management with robust user role management. It allows administrators to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently, ensuring secure and organized access control for inventory operations.

## Features

### User Role Management
The user role management feature enables administrators to efficiently oversee access control within the homestock management system. Admins can add new users by specifying their email, password, and role, ensuring secure onboarding. They can also create and assign user roles, such as "Admin" or "Staff," with customizable permissions like inventory management or user oversight. Additionally, admins have the ability to edit user details, update roles, or remove users and permissions as needed, maintaining system security and operational efficiency.
